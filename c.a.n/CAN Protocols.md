# CAN Protocol Introduction

This section provides an overview of the purpose and functionality of the CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol and its widespread applications.

## Purpose and Functionality of CAN Protocol

The CAN protocol is designed to allow multiple microcontrollers and devices within a network, particularly in automotive and industrial settings, to communicate with each other without a host computer.

## Areas of Application

CAN is predominantly used in automotive applications for in-vehicle networking but is also prevalent in industrial automation, medical equipment, and other embedded systems.

# CAN Message Frames

Understanding the structure and types of CAN message frames is crucial for comprehending how the CAN protocol operates.

## Standard vs. Extended CAN Frames

- **Standard CAN Frames**: Uses an 11-bit identifier.
- **Extended CAN Frames**: Employs a 29-bit identifier, allowing for more data payloads.

## Frame Structure

- **Identifier**: Unique identifier for message prioritization.
- **Control Field**: Indicates the size of the data field.
- **Data Field**: Carries the actual data.
- **CRC**: Cyclic Redundancy Check for error detection.
- **ACK**: Acknowledgment field.
