## What is CAN Communication?

CAN communication is a network protocol that enables reliable data exchange between various devices. It is widely used for communication between electronic systems in vehicles.

### History of CAN Communication

CAN communication was developed in the 1980s by Bosch, a German company. Initially designed for in-vehicle networking, it has since been adopted in various industrial sectors.

### Basic Principles of CAN Communication

CAN communication follows a multi-master serial bus standard, meaning each device on the network has the authority to transmit messages.
